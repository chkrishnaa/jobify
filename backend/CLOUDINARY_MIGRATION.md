- ✅ Enhanced file type support: Images (JPG, PNG, JPEG) + Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- ✅ Added file size limit: 10MB

### 4. Route Updates

## Cloudinary Configuration

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dqajspazz
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=132367933917145
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=X3b1AHkinmeoTsKqMO92UZMEmgQ
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Deployment Ready**: No more local file storage issues
2. **Scalable**: Cloud storage handles any number of files
3. **CDN**: Faster file delivery worldwide
4. **Backup**: Automatic file backup and redundancy
5. **Security**: Files stored securely in the cloud
6. **Cost Effective**: Pay only for storage used

## File Types Supported

- **Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- **Size Limit**: 10MB per file

## Usage

Files uploaded through the `/api/auth/upload-image` endpoint now return Cloudinary URLs instead of local file paths. The frontend will automatically work with these URLs.

## Testing

- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ All syntax checks pass
- ✅ No remaining references to local uploads
- ✅ Cloudinary configuration loaded correctly

## Next Steps

1. Test file upload functionality
2. Verify saved files appear in Cloudinary dashboard
3. Test file deletion (if implemented)
4. Monitor Cloudinary usage and costs
